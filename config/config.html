<h3>Simple Runner!</h3>
<p>
  Jobs are run on the same maching as the main strider instance, in a
  child process. This is the simplest option, but is also potentially
  insecure -- an evil test suite could delete your strider instance,
  etc. <strong>Only test trusted projects</strong> using this
  runner. For arbitrary projects, check
  out <a href="https://github.com/Strider-CD/strider-docker-runner">Docker
  Runner</a>.
